## Overview

*eegUtils* is a package for the processing, manipulation, and plotting
of EEG data. It includes functions for importing data from a variety of
file formats (including Biosemi, Brain Vision Analyzer, and EEGLAB),
many of the typical steps in pre-preprocessing (filtering, referencing,
artefact rejection), more advanced processing techniques (time-frequency
analysis, ICA), and several types of plot that are common in the field
(ERP plots, time-frequency plots, topographical scalp maps). Although it
uses custom object classes, it is designed such that these are always
translatable to standard R *data.frames*, and thus can be used with any
of the myriad packages and methods that support standard R formats.

## Installation

The package is very much under active development and is subject to a
lot of changes. As such, it is not currently available on CRAN.

Install the latest released version from Github as below.

``` r
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("craddm/eegUtils")
```

To install the latest development version, install from the *develop*
branch as below.

``` r
remotes::install_github("craddm/eegUtils@develop")
```

You can also find the package on
[Neuroconductor](https://neuroconductor.org) - for more information
about installing packages from Neuroconductor, see the [Neuroconductor
installation tutorial](https://neuroconductor.org/tutorials/install)

## Usage

The following examples show how to use `eegUtils` to produce a few
common plots of EEG data from some simple included example data.

### ERP butterfly plots

``` r
library(eegUtils)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'eegUtils'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     filter
plot_butterfly(demo_epochs)
#> Joining, by = c("epoch", "recording", "epoch_label", "participant_id")
```

### Topographical plots

``` r
topoplot(demo_epochs, 
         time_lim = c(.22, .25 ))
#> Joining, by = c("epoch", "recording", "epoch_label", "participant_id")
#> Using electrode locations from data.
```

### Power spectral density

``` r
plot_psd(demo_epochs)
#> Removing channel means per epoch...
```

### Time-frequency analysis

``` r
plot_tfr(compute_tfr(demo_epochs,
                     foi = c(4, 30),
                     n_freq = 20,
                     n_cycles = 3))
#> Output frequencies: 4 5.37 6.74 8.11 9.47 10.84 12.21 13.58 14.95 16.32 17.68 19.05 20.42 21.79 23.16 24.53 25.89 27.26 28.63 30
#> Removing channel means per epoch...
```

There are many potential processing steps that precede the production of
plots like these. For more examples of how to import and process data,
or import data from other sources, see the [eegUtils
