\title{eegUtils: A collection of utilities for EEG analysis}
\description{
eegUtils is a package for the processing, manipulation, and plotting of EEG
data. It includes functions for importing data from a variety of file formats
(including Biosemi, Brain Vision Analyzer, and EEGLAB), many of the typical
steps in pre-preprocessing (filtering, referencing, artefact rejection), more
advanced processing techniques (time-frequency analysis, ICA), and many types
of plot that are common in the field (ERP plots, time-frequency plots,
topographical scalp maps). Although it uses custom object classes, it is
designed such that these are always translatable to standard R data.frames,
and thus can be used with any of the myriad packages and methods that support
standard R formats.
