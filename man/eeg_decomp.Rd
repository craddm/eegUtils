\description{
Implements a selection of Generalized Eigenvalue based decomposition methods
for EEG signals. Intended for isolating oscillations at specified
frequencies, decomposing channel-based data into distinct components
reflecting distinct or combinations of sources of oscillatory signals.
Currently, spatio-spectral decomposition (Nikulin, Nolte, & Curio, 2011) and
Rhythmic Entrainment Source Separation (Cohen & Gulbinate, 2017) are
implemented. The key difference between the two is that the former returns
the results of the data-derived spatial filters applied to the
bandpass-filtered "signal" data, whereas the latter returns the resuls of the
filters applied to the original, broadband data.
