}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{An \code{eeg_data} or \code{eeg_epochs} object to be filtered}

\item{...}{Additional parameters.}

\item{low_freq}{Low cutoff frequency.}

\item{high_freq}{High cutoff frequency.}

\item{filter_order}{Defaults to "auto", which automatically estimates filter order for the specified filter characteristics (defaults to 4 if method = "iir").}

\item{trans_bw}{Transition bandwidth of the filter. "auto" or an integer.
"auto" attempts to determine a suitable transition bandwidth using the
heuristic given below. Ignored if method = "iir".}

\item{method}{"fir" (Finite Impulse Response) or "iir" (Infinite Impulse
Response). Defaults to "fir".}

\item{window}{Windowing function to use (FIR filtering only). Defaults to
"hamming"; currently only "hamming" available.}

\item{demean}{Remove DC component (i.e. channel/epoch mean) before filtering. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\description{
Perform IIR or FIR filtering on input EEG data of class \code{eeg_data} or
\code{eeg_epochs}. WARNING: with epoched data, epoch boundaries are currently
ignored, which can result in minor edge artifacts.
}
\details{
low_freq and high_freq are the low and high cutoff frequencies. Pass low freq
or high freq alone to perform high-pass or low-pass filtering respectively.
For band-pass or band-stop filters, pass both low_freq and high_freq.

If low_freq < high_freq, bandpass filtering is performed.

If low_freq > high_freq, bandstop filtering is performed.

Note that it is recommended to first zero-mean the signal using either
channel means or by-channel epoch means.

The function allows parallelization using the `future` package, e.g. using
`plan(multiprocess)`
}
\section{FIR versus IIR filtering}{
 Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering is
  performed using an overlap-add FFT method. Note that this only performs a
  single-pass; the data is shifted back in time by the group delay of the
  filter to compensate for the phase delay imposed by the linear filtering
  process. Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filtering is performed using a
  two-pass (once forwards, once reversed) method to correct for phase
  alignment.
