\arguments{
\item{data}{Data to be filtered.}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to S3 methods}

\item{low_freq}{Low passband edge.}

\item{srate}{Sampling rate of the signal.}

\item{silent}{Turns off filtering messages.}
}
\description{
Construct a Butterworth IIR filter and filter input data. This uses
\code{signal::filt_filt}, which filters the signal twice to - once forwards,
then again backwards).
}
\details{
low_freq and high_freq are passband edges. Pass low freq or high freq alone
to perform high-pass or low-pass filtering respectively. For band-pass or
band-stop filters, pass both low_freq and high_freq.

If low_freq < high_freq, bandpass filtering is performed.

If low_freq > high_freq, bandstop filtering is performed.

Note that the signal is first zero-meaned using either channel means or
by-channel epoch means.
