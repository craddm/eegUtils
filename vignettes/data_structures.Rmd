## eeg_data objects

`eeg_data` objects are the base class that all objects in this framework have. When raw data is imported, the output is this class. Currently, this class is a list constituting the following entries:

* `signals`
    + A data frame containing the actual EEG data in wide format. Each column is data from a single electrode, each row from a single timepoint.

* `srate` 
    + A single integer giving the sampling rate of the data in Hz

* `events`
    + A data.frame/tibble with 3 columns describing the events recorded in the data.
        + event_onset (in samples) relative to *recording onset*
        + event_time (in seconds) relative to *recording onset*
        + event_type (typically integer, others possible)

* `chan_info`
    + Typically NA on import as no channel locations are usually available in raw data.
    + A data.frame/tibble containing channel location information can be added. Currently similar to EEGLAB style, with the following columns (may change):
        * `labels` - channel names
        * `type` - Designator for channel type (e.g., EEG/EOG). Not currently used for anything.
        * `theta` - 
        * `radius`
        * `X`
        * `Y`
        * `Z`
        * `sph.theta`
        * `sph.phi`
        * `sph.radius`
        * `urchan`
        * `ref`

* `timings`
    + A data.frame containing a description of each row in time (s) and sample numbers (samples)

* `continuous`
    + A logical variable indiciating if the data is continuous or epoched. To be phased out now that multiple classes exist.

* `reference`
    + NA on loading, in the absence of a recorded reference channel.
    * Once data is referenced, is a list consisting of two entries.
        * `ref_chans` - Labels for channels used to calculate the reference data. Can also be "average".
        * `excluded` - Labels for any channels excluded from the reference data.

## eeg_epochs

`eeg_epochs` objects share the same overall structure with `eeg_data` objects, but some of the internals currently differ, as described below.

* `events`
    - The events table has two additional columns, `epoch` and `time`.
        - `epoch` gives the epoch number to which a given event belongs
        - `time` gives the time point at which the event occurs relative to the *epoch onset*
        - `event_time` still gives the time point at which the event occurs relative to the *recording onset*
        
* `timings`
    * The timings table has one additional column, `epoch`.
        - `epoch` gives the epoch number to which a given datapoint belongs
        - `sample` still uniquely identifies each datapoint
        - `time` now gives the time relative to the zero-point of the epoch, i.e. the *event* on which the epoch is centred.
