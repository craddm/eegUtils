Here we show how to fit a linear model to a single subject's data. We'll use the data from the LIMO EEG datase [^1] - [S1](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/2189?show=full)

This data is from a two-alternative forced choice experiment in which participants had to discriminate between two different faces. Across the course of the experiment, the faces were also varied in their phase coherence from 0% to 85%. The more phase coherent the face images, the easier they were to discriminate from each other.

```{r}
limo_test <- import_set("limo_dataset_S1.set")
limo_cont <- R.matlab::readMat("continuous_variable.mat")
limo_cat <- readr::read_csv("categorical_variable.txt",
                            col_names = c("cond_lab"))
```

The `fit_glm()` linear model fitting function in `eegUtils` looks in the `epochs` field of the data structures as predictors. To use these for linear modelling here, we'll add the categorical and continuous predictors to the `epochs` structure.

```{r}
epochs(limo_test) <- dplyr::mutate(epochs(limo_test),
                            phase_coherence = unlist(limo_cont),
                            face = factor(limo_cat$cond_lab,
                                          levels = c(1, 2),
                                          labels = c("Face_A",
                                                     "Face_B")))
epochs(limo_test)

```

The first argument to `fit_glm()` is a standard R formula, using Wilkinson notation. Unusually, the left hand side of the `~` is omitted, since we'll be fitting the model to every electrode at every timepoint. On the right hand side, we put our predictors. In this case, we have two: `face`, a categorical predictor; and `phase_coherence`, a continuous predictor. The appropriate formula is thus `~face + phase_coherence`. 

R's default contrasts are *treatment* or *dummy* contrasts, so we expect the model to return three coefficients: an *intercept*, which will be the amplitude when the categorical predictor is at its first level (i.e. Face A) and when phase coherence is 0; a *face* term, which will be the *difference* in amplitude from the *intercept* when the level of Face is `Face B`; and a *phase_coherence* term, which will be the increase in amplitude when image phase coherence increases from 0 to 1.

We can convert the fitted model into a standard data.frame using the `as.data.frame` function. By default, this returns the coefficients for each time point for each electrode. The `values` argument can be used to request other statistics by passing "coefficients", "std_err", "t_stats", or "r_sq".

```{r}
fitted_model <- fit_glm(~ face + phase_coherence,
                        data = limo_test)
as.data.frame(fitted_model,
              long = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time,
             y = amplitude,
             colour = electrode)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~coefficient,
             scales = "free") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

An alternative paramterization would be to remove the intercept term. The function would then return separate coefficients representing `Face A` and `Face B`. This would be particularly helpful if you are planning to take these coefficients forwards to a second-level analysis.

```{r}
fitted_model_no_int <- fit_glm(~0 + face + phase_coherence,
                        data = limo_test)
as.data.frame(fitted_model_no_int,
              long = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time,
             y = amplitude,
             colour = electrode)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~coefficient,
             scales = "free") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

Continuous predictors can be rescaled using the `scale()` function, which converts them to z-scores (i.e. standard deviation units).

```{r}
fitted_model_zscore <- fit_glm(~0 + face + scale(phase_coherence),
                        data = limo_test)
as.data.frame(fitted_model_zscore,
              long = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time,
             y = amplitude,
             colour = electrode)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~coefficient,
             scales = "free") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The function also provide additional information. For example, we can get the $r^2$ value representing model fit:

```{r}
fitted_model$r_sq %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = channel_names(limo_test),
               names_to = "electrode",
               values_to = "r_sq") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time,
             y = r_sq,
             colour = electrode)) +
  geom_line() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
